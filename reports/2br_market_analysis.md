## Negotiation Context

Based on current market data:

2. **If between $1,066-$1,517** - You're in the mid-to-upper range. Reasonable leverage to push for staying at current rate or modest increase.

3. **If around $1,066** - You're at the market median. Fair pricing, limited leverage for reduction.

4. **If below $727** - You're in the bottom quartile. Landlord may push for increase to market rate.

## Recommendation

Use the **median price of $1,066** as your anchor point in negotiations. If your landlord proposes an increase, counter with data showing the current market median and argue that any increase above this rate would price you out of fair market value for a 2-bedroom in these neighborhoods.

The wide range ($727-$1,517 for the middle 50%) suggests significant variability based on:
- Specific neighborhood within the area
- Building amenities
- Condition/age of property
- Floor level and views

Consider highlighting comparable properties in your specific sub-neighborhood to strengthen your position.
